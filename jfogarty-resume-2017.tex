\noindent \emph{Software geek and technical manager with broad and deep skill sets, and a lifelong passion for learning --- as happy directing small companies, as when excelling as a squeaky wheel in the machine of the world's largest software company.}
\\
\\
In junior high I wrote my first code from a \textit{\acr{GE}} timesharing, library book; programs in hand, I tracked down the admin for the \textit{Burrough}'s mainframe in the Dallas school district and convinced him let me use their machine. Before finishing high school, I was doing compiler work on the \textit{\acr{UT} Health Science Center's \acr{DEC}system}, and had mastered a dozen languages across multiple systems.
\\
\\
I attended Rice University on a full ticket National Merit Scholarship, but was appalled at the primitive \acr{IBM} mainframe in the \acr{CS} department; I studied physics before dropping out to found my first company. Coupled with my hobbyist's skills in electronics, I was soon developing embedded computers, operating systems, and communications protocols for \textit{Hewlett Packard}, \textit{AT\&T}, \textit{\acr{DEC}}, \textit{Azurdata}, in my next two startups.
\\
\\
In my twenties, I managed a staff of dozens of designers and engineers covering every aspect of manufacturing networked, industrial, computer systems. I've traveled throughout Europe and Asia, both troubleshooting software/hardware, and handling the technical side of systems sales. Developed business plans, engineering and production budgets, and served on the boards of multiple small companies.
\\
\\
For next two decades, I've alternated and interleaved deep technical work with the direction of teams and engineering departments. Whenever expanded management responsibilities have threatened to erode my skills, I've switched to roles demanding greater technical depth and commitment.
\\
\\
For the last few years, my wife Mary and I have been sailing a small sailboat around the US and Mexico, while I've again immersed myself in personal studies; this time in neuroscience, cognitive science, and artificial intelligence. I'm currently completing  a book on general \acr{AI}, ``\href{http://consideringthought.com/}{\textit{Considering Thought}},'' to be published later this year.
